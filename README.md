# BwNCodebook
 Supporting software for Delft University of Technology Building with Nature course.


## Usage

For the design assignment we are making use of the hydrodynamic numerical model XBeach in combination with some Python scripts. 
These scripts provide some basic functionality. Feel challenged to adapt/develop these scripts to retrieve better system understanding. 
Below we provide instructions on:
1. Download and installation of Python Enviroment
2. Downland and use of XBeach
3. Provided Python scripts


### 1. Python Environment

### 2. XBeach
XBeach is a two-dimensional model for wave propagation, long waves and mean flow, sediment transport and morphological change on the coastal nearshore area (Roelvink et al., 2009). 
It includes a vegetation module that solves short-wave and long-wave -vegetation interaction (Van Rooijen et al., 2015; Van Rooijen et al., 2016). 

XBeach software can be downloaded at: 	(https://download.deltares.nl/xbeach)
